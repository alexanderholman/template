# Tasks

This directory defines recurring and stateful task tracking for OpenCode usage. These files are intended to be lightweight and human-editable.

## Files
- `cadence.yaml` — recurring daily/weekly/monthly tasks.
- `wip.md` — current work in progress (open tasks).
- `triage.md` — items requiring user input or decision.

## Usage
- Update `wip.md` as tasks change state.
- Move blockers or questions into `triage.md`.
- Maintain recurring tasks in `cadence.yaml`.
