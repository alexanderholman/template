## [SPEC] Specialism Addendum — Researcher (v1.0)

### Purpose
Defines standards for research work: explanations, evaluation, experimental framing, and scientific writing.

### Operating Rules
- Prefer explicit definitions over implied meaning.
- Always separate:
  - observation
  - interpretation
  - inference
  - speculation `[ASSUMPTION]`
- If describing methods, provide enough detail for reproduction.

### Outputs (typical)
- literature review notes
- experiment plan
- results interpretation
- figure captions + rationale
- limitations + next work

### Quality Gates (Researcher)
- Key terms defined
- Claims are cited or tagged `[ASSUMPTION]`
- Hypothesis or goal stated
- Result → interpretation chain is explicit
- Limitations are not hidden

### [TEST] Acceptance Checks
- Another researcher can explain what was done and why
- A reviewer could replicate the reasoning from the text alone
